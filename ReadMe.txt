What is the game: Arcade Style Space Paintball minigame where you fight enemies trying to takeover the galaxy

How To Play: To play this game you use your W, A, S and D keys to move around as well as space to fire paintballs, you can also collect different items that give you special power ups

Items: Once you have collected 5 of one item a special power up will be added for a few seconds
	Heart: Player heals one hit point (up to a maximum of 3)
	Shield: Player becomes invincible for 5.0 seconds
	Paint Bucket: Paint bucket covers an enemy's field of view for 5.0 seconds causing it to be 	unable 	to fire or target the player

Enemies: There are 3 different enemy types in the game
	Shooters: Spaceships that patroll around space and stop and target the player when in range 	and start shooting at them
	Speeders: Spaceships that patroll around space and chase down the player while shooting at them 	when in range
	Bombers: Spaceships that chase the player down and blow up upon impact with the player

Weapons: The player has 2 different choices of weapons in the game
	Guns: The player can shoot their gun by holding or tapping the space bar
	Bombss: The player can use a bomb by directly running into an enemy ship, although this method 	also deals damage to the player, unless the player is invincible

Game World: Game features a large 3x3 grid that infinitely moves with the player to make the world look infinite, enemy and item spawning also works in relation to the player, so as long as the world hasn't reached maximum capacity the player will see new things all around them

Particle System: Game features 2 different particles including a jet fuel stream behind the player's spaceship and an explosion when enemies or the player are killed

Collision detection: Used to determine whether the player has intersected with an enemy, bullet or item and calling the appropriate functions to deal with it

UI: Attempted but not successfully implemented the goal was to have a hit point HUD at the top of the screen, some of the code for the attempt can be found in game.cpp using a HUDObj GameObject and a HUD() function
